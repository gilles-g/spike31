### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

```ts
import php from 'php.net'
import symfony from 'symfony.com'
import TDD from 'code.quality.com'
import DDD from 'blue.book.com'
import design_pattern from 'code.quality.com'
import vue from 'vuejs.com'
import open_source from 'github.com'

remove reactjs, angular from 'not_any_more.com'

while currentJob == 'developer'
    
```

I'm a french developer

I'm the main contributor for all bundles in [Lexik](https://github.com/lexik)

I like to take on new challenges

After almost 10 years doing Symfony, I had time to see my priorities evolve on the development of a project.

At first what mattered most was writing code, doing tests, and writing more code.

But we realize that the code we write evolves constantly, ultimately it is never frozen forever.

You have to know how to question yourself, and look at what has been done elsewhere and for a long time. Developers are often in the moment, yet computer programs have been around for decades.

Today what interests me in a project is its global representation. Domain Driven Design showed me how you can collaborate with other people who are not developers, in order to write code that meets both the needs of the client but also the satisfaction of the developer.

How many projects do I have to my credit? Difficult to count them all. On the other hand, I remember those that I missed, those from which I learned and those that work with thunder.

Those that work best are those where we took the time to analyze the client's needs, to have written code in hexagonal architectures and decoupled from frameworks and databases.

In the end it is so simple to write complex projects if we remove the pieces that cause us problems.

Write pure PHP code, forget about your framework, add unit test and ask  for help
